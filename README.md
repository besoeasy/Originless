## Quick Start

### Umbrel (One-Click)

[![Install on Umbrel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Umbrel-Install%20Now-5351FB?style=for-the-badge&logo=umbrel&logoColor=white)](https://apps.umbrel.com/app/file-drop)

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3232:3232 \
  -p 4001:4001/tcp \
  -p 4001:4001/udp \
  -v file-drop-data:/data \
  --name file-drop \
  ghcr.io/besoeasy/file-drop:main
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  file-drop:
    image: ghcr.io/besoeasy/file-drop:main
    container_name: file-drop
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3232:3232"
      - "4001:4001/tcp"
      - "4001:4001/udp"
    volumes:
      - file-drop-data:/data
    environment:
      - STORAGE_MAX=50GB
      - FILE_LIMIT=5GB

volumes:
  file-drop-data:
```

Open **http://localhost:3232** after starting.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `STORAGE_MAX` | `200GB` | Maximum IPFS storage before garbage collection |
| `FILE_LIMIT` | `5GB` | Maximum size per file upload |

**Volume Mount:** The `/data` volume persists your IPFS repository. Without it, all files are lost on container restart.

## API Quick Reference

### Upload a File

```bash
curl -X PUT -F "file=@photo.jpg" http://localhost:3232/upload
```

**Returns IPFS CID and gateway URL.**

### Check Server Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:3232/health
```

## How It Works

1. **Upload** – Files are added to your local IPFS node (unpinned)
2. **Propagate** – Content spreads across the IPFS network as peers request it
3. **Access** – Files accessible via any IPFS gateway, even if your server goes offline
4. **Cleanup** – When storage fills, oldest/least-accessed files are garbage collected

> **Note:** Files are temporary by design. Popular files persist longer; old unused files are cleaned up automatically.

**Use cases:**
- Chat apps (file attachments)
- Social platforms (media uploads)
- Forums (embedded content)
- CDN replacement for static assets
